# Animation Overview

There are four primary components that must be implemented to support Animation functionality.

**A4.0**

- [(Task 1) Spline Interpolation](splines.md)
- [(Task 2) Skeleton Kinematics](skeleton_kinematics.md)

**A4.5**
- Soon to come


Each of these components is described at the linked page.

Additionally, the assignment specification asks you to create a video of your animation. Some brief technical notes on creating videos from images are [here](generate_videos.md).
